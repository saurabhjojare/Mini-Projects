## Chatbot Response System in Python (using NLTK) 

The Intelligent Chatbot project aims to enhance the user experience by providing a conversational and intelligent interface capable of understanding and responding to user queries effectively. This project presents an opportunity to explore and implement NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms in the field of chatbot development.

## Features

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): The system utilizes NLP techniques to understand user input and generate appropriate responses.
- Pretrained Models: It includes pretrained models (e.g., language models, intent classifiers, named entity recognizers) to assist in understanding and processing user queries.
- Intent Recognition: The system can recognize the intent behind user queries, allowing it to provide contextually relevant responses.
- Customizable Responses: Developers can define custom responses or dialog flows for specific queries or conversation patterns.
  
## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Libraries: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## Prerequisites
### NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a powerful Python library widely used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It provides various tools and resources for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and more. NLTK is open-source and offers a vast collection of text corpora, lexical resources, and pre-trained models for research and development in NLP.

Installation of NLTK
```
pip install nltk
```
## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
git clone https://github.com/saurabhjojare/Chatbot-Response-System.git

3. Start the application by running the following command:
   
* Jupyter Notebook

You can run the chatbot.ipynb which also includes step by step instructions.

* Through Terminal
```
python chatbot.py
```

## History 

History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum. It imitated the language of a psychotherapist from only 200 lines of code. You can still converse with it here: [Eliza](http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm?utm_source=ubisend.com&utm_medium=blog-link&utm_campaign=ubisend).
